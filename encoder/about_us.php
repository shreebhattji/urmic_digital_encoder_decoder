            <h3>ShreeBhattJi</h3>
            <p>If you’ve ever read the Panchatantra, a few stories begin like this: “Once upon a time, there lived a poor Brahmin in a village.” In this story, that Brahmin is me — ShreeBhattJi, also known as Devdatt Bhatt, the King of Automation and Remote Control from the land of great beginnings, Bhavnagar.

            <h3>Bhavnagar :- The Land Of Great Beginnings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The great country called India began to exist at Bhavnagar. On 15 August 1947, Indian administrative control effectively began with Bhavnagar after Maharaja Krishnakumarsinhji Bhavsinhji Gohil merged his princely state into the independent Union of India.</li>
                <p>
                    <li>The “bull gift” from Maharaja Krishnakumarsinhji of Bhavnagar to Brazilian cattle baron Celso Garcia Sid helped shape the Brazilian dairy industry, leading to the world-famous Girolando breed. Today, Girolando cows produce over 80% of Brazil’s milk. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLJHFibZ130">DD INDIA REPORT</a></li>
                <p>
                    <li>The first diamond-cutting industry in India started in Bhavnagar, not Surat. Skilled jewelers and artisans in Bhavnagar (Saurashtra region, Gujarat) began cutting and polishing small rough diamonds imported from Africa. These craftsmen later moved to Surat, which eventually became the world’s largest diamond-cutting and polishing hub.</li>
                <p>
                    <li>The largest ship-breaking yard in the world, “Alang Ship Breaking Yard,” located in Bhavnagar district, Gujarat, started operations in 1983. It handles over 50% of global ship recycling by tonnage and is a major source of recycled steel for India’s economy.</li>
                <p>
                    <li>After the Kurukshetra war, the Pandavas sought absolution for the killing that occurred in battle. Following the guidance of Lord Krishna, who gave them a black flag and a black cow, they were instructed to follow the cow until both turned white. Krishna told them that when this happened, they would be forgiven. The Pandavas followed the cow for many years to various places, but the flag and cow remained black. Finally, when they reached Koliyak Beach, both miraculously turned white.</li>
